Common Mistakes

Q: print "____________"; doesn't work as expected
A: __"..." marks a translation. If this character pattern shows up
   in your source you might get problems. Try to escape it like this
   print "___________\_";

Q: My application is writen n language XYZ, but this language
   is not shown in teh language_selector!
A: All languages used in the source must be declared somewhere. If
   you use lang="*" then you must declare all possible source languages
   using the <language> element.

Q: I try to access %A/%S, a database etc. in a callback, but it does not
   work.
A: The callback handlers are executed during a very delicate time, before
   the actual page gets executed. %S etc. are meaningless during this time.
   If you want to access something you should take a reference to it and
   pass it to your callback when you refer() to the callback.

Features

Q: How do I get the currently selected language?
A: my $langid = $papp_ppkg_table->lang

Q: How can I quickly get a language selector for all supported languages?
A: <:language_selector $papp_translator, $papp_ppkg_table->lang:>

Q: How do I include a filename in a surl (e.g. for a nice Save As preset)
A: Use the GET surlstyle together with SURL_SUFFIX, e.g:
   surl "download", SURL_STYLE_GET, SURL_SUFFIX, "doc.ps";

Unexplainable Errors

Q: I get an error like "self is not of type PApp::I18n::Table" while
   my application gets compiled. What gives?
A: You are calling __ or gettext in your module initialization code. This
   is too early sicne there is no user and thus no selected language at
   that point.
