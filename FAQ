Common Mistakes

Q: I am using SURL_SET_LANG => 'xxx' (or any other SURL cookie) but it
   doesn't seem to work.
A: Perl auto-quotes the identifier preceding "=>", so the above just sets
   the state key "SURL_SET_LANG". Use a normal comma instead:
   SURL_SET_LANG, 'xxx'.

Q: print "____________"; doesn't work as expected
A: __"..." marks a translation. If this character pattern shows up
   in your source you might get problems. Try to escape it like this
   print "___________\_";

Features

Q: How do I get the currently selected language?
A: my $langid = $papp_ppkg_table->lang

Q: How can I quickly get a language selector for all supported languages?
A: <:language_selector $papp_translator, $papp_ppkg_table->lang:>

Q: How do I include a filename in a surl (e.g. for a nice Save As preset)
A: Use the GET surlstyle together with SURL_SUFFIX, e.g:
   surl "download", SURL_STYLE_GET, SURL_SUFFIX, "doc.ps";

Unexplainable Errors

Q: I get an error like "self is not of type PApp::I18n::Table" while
   my application gets compiled. What gives?
A: You are calling __ or gettext in your module initialization code. This
   is too early sicne there is no user and thus no selected language at
   that point.
