INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Installation is difficult, and this document is badly written, so keep
confident ;)

REQUIRENMENTS

- mysql (version 3.24 recommended), other databases might work, but
  probably require small changes (I'd be interested to hear about
  problems, though!).

- mod_perl -OR- speedycgi
  mod_perl is the recommended and fastest way. if you can't get mod_perl, try
  the CGI::SpeedyCGI module. If even that fails, you could still use PApp,
  but it will not be funny for you (read: dog-slow).


INSTALLATION STEP-BY-STEP

1. compile and install this module, as usual:
   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

2. create the papp database on your mysql server
   read gen-db.sql first, and checker wether it is ok for your database!

   $ mysql <gen-db.sql

   should create a new database "papp"

3a. mod_perl:
   configure apache, see the included httpd.conf

3b. speedycgi:
   not working yet ;)
