<section title="Common Mistakes">

<qa q='print "____________"; doesn&apos;t work as expected'>

<c>__"..."</c> marks a translation. If this character pattern shows up
in your source you might get problems. Try to escape it like this
<c>print "___________\_";</c>

</qa>

<qa q='My application is written in language XYZ, but this language is not shown in the language_selector!'>

All languages used in the source must be declared somewhere. If you use
<c>lang="*"</c> then you must declare all possible source languages using the
<c>&lt;language></c> element.

</qa>

<qa q='I try to access %A/%S, a database etc. in a callback, but it does not work.'>

The callback handlers are executed during a very delicate time, before
the actual page gets executed. <c>%S</c> etc. are meaningless during this
time.  If you want to access something you should take a reference to it
and pass it to your callback when you refer() to the callback.

<qa q='How do I get the currently selected language?'>

<c>my $langid = $papp_ppkg_table->lang</c>

</qa>

<qa q='How can I quickly get a language selector for all supported languages?'>

<c>&lt;:language_selector $papp_translator, $papp_ppkg_table->lang:></c>

</qa>

<qa q='How do I include a filename in a surl (e.g. for a nice Save As preset)'>

Use the GET surlstyle together with SURL_SUFFIX, e.g: surl "download",
SURL_STYLE_GET, SURL_SUFFIX, "doc.ps";

</qa>

<qa q='How can I dynamically initialize the default database used by my app?'>

<p>
Use a perl section and call the <c>$ppkg->set_database</c> method:
</p>

<p>
<c>&lt;perl>$ppkg->set_database(new PApp::SQL::Database ...)&lt;/perl></c>
</p>

</qa>

<section title='Unexplainable Errors'>

<qa q='I get an error like "self is not of type PApp::I18n::Table" while my application gets compiled. What gives?'>

You are calling <c>__</c> or <c>gettext</c> in your module initialization
code. This is too early since there is no user and thus no selected
language at that point.
