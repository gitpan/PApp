=head1 NAME

PApp::Log - analyze and expire the state/user databases

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PApp::Log;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

PApp creates a new database entry for its C<%state> hash for every new
pageview. This state entry is usually between 100-4000 bytes in size, for
an average of about 700-800 bytes, heavily depending on your application.

Clearly, the state database must be wiped clean from old states regularly.
Similarly the user database must be cleaned up from anonymous users that
didn't visit your site for a long time.

This module helps doing this, while at the same time giving you the
ability to analyze the access patterns on your site/application, for
example anonymizing and summarizing user behaviour to get the highly
needed statistics for your customers.

There are two different tasks: logging of state/user entries (as done by
C<log_state>) und cleaning the state/user database of expired entries (done
by C<expire_db>).

C<expire_db> also calls C<log_state> and is usually the function you need to
call.

=head2 Callbacks

During logging, the following callbacks will be called for the applications
that define them:

=over 4

=item expire_user $username, $comment

=item expire_state $ctime

=item for_user <BLOCK>;

Add a callback that is called for each user once before she is
removed. The callback is called with (userid, username, comment, prefs),
where C<prefs> is a hash representing the user's preferences in PApp's
internal format which will change anytime.

=item for_state <BLOCK>, [option => value...]

Add a callback that is called for each state (each unique page-view
generates one entry in the state database). The callback is called
with two hashes, the first a hash containing meta information (see below),
the second is just your standard C<%state> hash.

Contents of the meta hash:

 ctime        time this page was last viewed (unix timestamp)
 previd       parent state id
 userid       userid in effect when that state was created
 pmod         the (non-compiled) application

Additional options:

 app          call only for this application
 location     call only for this location
 module       call only for this module

You can get a reference to the location-specific C<%S> by using:

 $S = $state->{$meta->{location}};

Examples:

Define a callback that is called for every state:

   for_state {
      my ($meta, $state) = @_;
      print "STATE ",
            "APP=$meta->{pmod}{name}, ",
            "LOC=$meta->{location}, ",
            "MOD=$state->{papp_module}\n";
   };

Define a callback that's only called for applications with the name "dbedit":

   for_state {
      ...
   } app => "dbedit";

=head2 Functions

=over 4

=item expire_db keepuser => <seconds>, keepstate => <seconds>, keepreguser => <seconds>.

Clean the user and state databases from old states, generating log events
for state and user-entries that expire but haven't been logged. This is
not (yet) atomic, so do not call this function concurrently.

 keepuser => <seconds> (default 60 days)
   the time after which unused anonymous users expire
 keepreguser => <seconds> (default 1 year)
   the time after which even registered users expire
 keepstate => <seconds> (default 14 days)
   the time after which unused state-entries expire
