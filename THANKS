Some people who really helped me during development of this module (or in
my life in general):

- Judith, meeting her was the best thing ever happened to me
- Stefan Traby, who really tested this module and destroyed all my wrong assumptions ;)
- Marco Maisenhelder, for continuously lending me his ear
- Lukas Grunwald, for constantly talking down on other, similar frameworks ;->
