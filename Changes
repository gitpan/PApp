Revision history for Perl extension PApp

0.04  Thu May 11 03:24:07 CEST 2000
	- too many things to remember.
        - a first try at an instalaltino script and a config mechanism
        - PApp::I18n now uses it's own format. With the
          (not-yet-implemented) pre-sorting it should require less random
          accesses then gettext. Also supports binary formats (i.e. you
          could gettextize images) and allows tagging info to be added to
          the string.

0.03  ???

0.02  ???
	- added multipart-parsing functions.
        - added %arg hash, and "one-shot arguments" (see surl).
        - modularization: many modules were split off into their
          own packages, this package was divided into many modules.
          The goal is still far away.
