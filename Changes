Revision history for Perl extension PApp

0.08  Sun Jun 18 23:53:50 CEST 2000
	- PApp now overwrites $SIG{__DIE__}, be careful!
	- PApp::Exception has a compatibility mode now.
        - fixed the preferences system to actually make *sense*.
        - fixed memory corruption bug in SQL.xs that happens
          because mod_perl BOOT:'s the same object twice :(
        - fixed documentation of PApp::I18n, PApp::FormBuffer.
        - PApp::Env and PApp::SQL should be more resistent to restarts.
        - removed gen-db.sql.
        - added PApp::DataRef.
        - added <description> tag to papp, maybe soon followed
          by <copyright> and <version>.
        - workaround for mod_perl or perl bug that causes the 'bool'ean
          value of error messages to be shown instead of their string
          value. Funny, might be the same bug as with Storable, but
          for totally different reasons ;)
        - DataRef'ied macro/editform and the apps that were using it.
        - PApp::SQL::*fetch methods call finish on the statement handle,
          as does sql_exec in void context.
        - load_prefs allows empty prefs settings and doesn't log you
          out if the preferences field is empty.
        - fixed PApp::Callback::create_callback.
        - added experimental preferences field for acedit.
        - surl now uses "use bytes" because otherwise.. strange things happen.
        - implemented ref-to-coderef special in PApp::XML.
        - _really_ commented out #?? in PApp/Parser.
        - added more compliation facilities to PApp::XML.
        - implemented "delayed" option which is handy for debugging
          (improves server restart speed at the expense of more memory).
        - DataRef/use base: worked around an overload bug in perl.
        - now flushing translation cache on childinit.
        - apps/poedit now allows finer-grained access rights "poedit_*" = all
          apps, "poedit_<app>" = application app etc...
        - various other small enhancements to apps/poedit, and i18n in general,
          much more to come!
        - added life-saving(!!!) index on papp.msgid.id, better execute
          "alter table papp.msgid add index (id(64))" on your existing
          installation(s).
        - fixed apps/dbedit error-reporting (what was it supposed to do?).
        - improved apps/acedit to also work on groups.

0.07  Fri Jun  9 22:14:36 CEST 2000
	- fixed dumb typoe in macro/util.papp :(
        - added PApp::Env module.
        - dbedit now assumes primary keys are strings that
          do not need quoting.
        - added PApp::Callback module.

0.06  Wed Jun  7 21:52:15 CEST 2000
	- poedit now uses the statedb.
        - admin now included poedit access right by default.
        - document PApp::Config rudimentarily.
        - PApp.pm makes use of PApp::Config now.
        - PApp::Config now by default uses a 256 bit key.
        - new env table for future "papp global environment".
        - added a LONG WIZARD EXAMPLE to PApp::XML's manpage.

0.05  Sat May 27 22:25:51 CEST 2000
	- added PApp::XML. Boring, but together with XML::XSLT it rocks!
	- implemented N_($).
        - addedd attrs to papp's macro element (specify subroutine
          attributes).
        - #endif and #else now allow whitespace on the same line
        - translate styel can be specified "plain" - full text,
          "code" - scan for __ substrings or "auto" for autodetect.

0.04  Thu May 11 03:24:07 CEST 2000
	- too many things to remember.
        - a first try at an installation script and a config mechanism.
        - PApp::I18n now uses it's own format. With the
          (not-yet-implemented) pre-sorting it should require less random
          accesses then gettext. Also supports binary formats (i.e. you
          could gettextize images) and allows tagging info to be added to
          the string.

0.03  ???

0.02  ???
	- added multipart-parsing functions.
        - added %arg hash, and "one-shot arguments" (see surl).
        - modularization: many modules were split off into their
          own packages, this package was divided into many modules.
          The goal is still far away.
