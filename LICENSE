PApp is not in the public domain. To legally use it, you must own a
license. The exact conditions under which you might use PApp are given
below in the PApp Public License. In less legally encumbered language: You
might use PApp free-of-charge unless you use it for profit, in which case
you need to buy a copy from us. Private and University use, for example,
is free but might require registration with us.

You can, of course, evaluate this software before you buy or register it.

We alternatively offer a version of PApp under the General Public
License. Please contact papp@nethype.de for more info on pricing (to cover
our development costs we expect around €100000 for the GPL version).
